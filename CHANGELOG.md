The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Pre-1.0 releases use the `0.MAJOR.MINOR-PRERELEASE.N` convention; expect breaking changes between alpha and beta.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-05

Initial public beta (first published pre-release). Continues the Komodo DeFi Framework codebase from the GPLv2 anchor commit `c1d46c0c1592faa0860f704008b2b2381bc3840f` (2022-06-03) under GPLv2-only.

For the full feature delta against the GLEEC fork of the upstream codebase, see [`RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md`](RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md).

Highlights:

- Mainnet support on netid 8762 (AtomicDEX) and netid 6133 (GLEEC).
- Stable Rust toolchain (no nightly pin).
- Self-hosted CI with split format / unit-test / docker-test jobs.
- On-demand release builds for Linux (additional platforms via the umbrella dev-build workflow).
- Documentation-only compatibility convention for GLEEC-equivalent operation (developer rule in [`docs/COMPAT_SWITCHES.md`](docs/COMPAT_SWITCHES.md), central admin chapter in [`docs/GLEEC_COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/GLEEC_COMPATIBILITY.md)); no divergent settings active in this release.
- Test-only netids (8100, 8999, 9000, 9998) gated behind the `regtest-netid` Cargo feature, off by default in production builds.
- EVM ABI encoding/decoding migrated from `ethabi` to `alloy` (`alloy-dyn-abi` / `alloy-json-abi` / `alloy-primitives`), guarded by a byte-identity golden regression suite.
- Tag-driven, GPG-signed release pipeline: signed `SHA256SUMS` manifest and drafted GitHub Releases — pre-releases from `staging` (`-alpha/-beta/-rc` tags), finals from `main`. Linux binaries build inside a Debian 11 container (glibc 2.31) for broad backwards-compatibility; unsigned all-platform snapshots via manual `dev-build.yml` and automatic `staging-build.yml`.
