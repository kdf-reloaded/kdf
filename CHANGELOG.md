# Changelog

All notable changes to KDF Reloaded are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Pre-1.0 releases use the `0.MAJOR.MINOR-PRERELEASE.N` convention; expect breaking changes between alpha and beta.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-beta.2] — 2026-07-07

Stability release focused on HD-wallet interoperability with the Komodo DeFi wallet (Flutter SDK). Continues from `0.1.0-beta.1` under GPLv2-only.

### Fixed

- **HD-wallet login no longer hangs on a spinner.** `RpcTaskStatus` now serialises the terminal state as `status: "Ok"` / `status: "Error"` (tagged `status`/`details`) instead of the previous `Ready` envelope, matching what the SDK's task-status polling expects. Applies to `task::enable_utxo`, `task::account_balance`, `task::create_new_account`, `task::withdraw` and other long-running task-status responses. Code: `mm2src/rpc_task/`.
- **Concurrent coin activation no longer throws `CoinIsAlreadyActivated`.** A coin already registered under a racing activation request is now treated as an idempotent success rather than surfacing an uncaught exception to the client. Code: `coins_activation/src/standalone_coin/init_standalone_coin.rs`.
- **HD balance responses are ticker-keyed.** `HDAccountBalance.total_balance` and `HDAddressBalance.balance` are now `{ "<TICKER>": { spendable, unspendable } }` maps, fixing the wallet's `PUBKEY_ACTIVATION_ERROR` / `"String is not a subtype of Map"` on HD activation. The legacy `my_balance` response is unchanged (remains a flat object). Code: `coins/coin_balance.rs` and HD balance/activation paths.

### Changed / divergences

- **Withdraw with an omitted HD `from` defaults to the enabled address** (account 0 / external / index 0) instead of failing with `FromAddressNotFound`. This is a deliberate divergence from GLEEC KDF, documented in [`RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md`](RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md); there is no compatibility switch in this release. An explicit but invalid `from` is still rejected.
- **Legacy `<db_root>/wallets/*.wallet` wallets are read (login/list/delete) but never written**; new wallets are always the canonical `<name>.json` record. Documented in [`RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md`](RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md) and CRD chapter 07 §7.5/§7.7 (R9A). The storage format does not by itself select HD vs single-address signing.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-05

Initial public beta (first published pre-release). Continues the Komodo DeFi Framework codebase from the GPLv2 anchor commit `c1d46c0c1592faa0860f704008b2b2381bc3840f` (2022-06-03) under GPLv2-only.

For the full feature delta against the GLEEC fork of the upstream codebase, see [`RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md`](RELOADED_VS_GLEEC.md).

Highlights:

- Mainnet support on netid 8762 (AtomicDEX) and netid 6133 (GLEEC).
- Stable Rust toolchain (no nightly pin).
- Self-hosted CI with split format / unit-test / docker-test jobs.
- On-demand release builds for Linux (additional platforms via the umbrella dev-build workflow).
- Documentation-only compatibility convention for GLEEC-equivalent operation (developer rule in [`docs/COMPAT_SWITCHES.md`](docs/COMPAT_SWITCHES.md), central admin chapter in [`docs/GLEEC_COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/GLEEC_COMPATIBILITY.md)); no divergent settings active in this release.
- Test-only netids (8100, 8999, 9000, 9998) gated behind the `regtest-netid` Cargo feature, off by default in production builds.
- EVM ABI encoding/decoding migrated from `ethabi` to `alloy` (`alloy-dyn-abi` / `alloy-json-abi` / `alloy-primitives`), guarded by a byte-identity golden regression suite.
- Tag-driven, GPG-signed release pipeline: signed `SHA256SUMS` manifest and drafted GitHub Releases — pre-releases from `staging` (`-alpha/-beta/-rc` tags), finals from `main`. Linux binaries build inside a Debian 11 container (glibc 2.31) for broad backwards-compatibility; unsigned all-platform snapshots via manual `dev-build.yml` and automatic `staging-build.yml`.
